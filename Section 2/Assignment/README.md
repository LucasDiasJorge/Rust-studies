- Create a struct called Car with the fields: mpg, color, and top_speed. Once the struct is created, implement the following methods: set_mpg, set_color, and set_top_speed. Once you have created these methods, create a car, provide it default values, and then set the mpg, color, and top speed and then print them out.

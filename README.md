# Rust Studies

Welcome to my **Rust Studies** repository! This is an ongoing project where I document my journey in learning Rust. Here, you'll find various sections that cover different aspects of the Rust programming language, from basic concepts like ownership and borrowing to more advanced topics like methods and structs.

### Sections Overview

- **Section 1**: Covers foundational Rust concepts, including variable assignment, ownership, and borrowing, which are essential for understanding Rust's memory management.

- **Section 2**: In progress ...

### Future Updates

This repository is a **work in progress**, and new content will be added as I continue to learn and explore more advanced topics in Rust. Feel free to follow along with my progress, and if you're also learning Rust, I hope this can be a useful resource for you too.
